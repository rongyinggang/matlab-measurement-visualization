# matlab-measurement-visualization

Measurement visualization in 3D.  A tool to visualizing the velocity of the shielding gas for the LPBF processing. 

A measurement result on 2019/01/09 with a settings file:  (For example)
- 20190109_Anemometrie_20x20x2_Test.7z 
- 20190109_Anemometrie_20x20x2_Test_Settings.7z

The measurrement is calibrated and arranged in a 3D space, in order to have an intuitive view of the result for furhter research.
